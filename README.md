# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of Project
In this project I use  unsupervised machine learning algorithms to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies and create a report including traded cryptocurrencies classified by grouping them according to their features. 
We use the following methods for the analysis:
  - Preprocessing the data
  - Reducing the data dimension using Principal Component Analysis
  - Clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means
  - Visualizing classification results with 2D and 3D scatterplots
